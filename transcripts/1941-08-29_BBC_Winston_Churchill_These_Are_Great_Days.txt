almost a year has passed since I came down here at your headmasters kind invitation. In order to share myself and share the hearts of a few of my friends, I see some of our own songs. The 10 months that have passed have seen very terrible catastrophic events in the world Ups and downs, misfortunes. But can anyone sitting here this afternoon this October afternoon not feel deeply thankful for what has happened in the time that has passed and for the very great improvement in the position of our country and of our home? Why? When I was here last time, we were quite alone desperately alone and we had bean. So from five or six months we were poorly armed. Were not poorly armed today, but then we were very poorly armed. We had the unmeasured minister of the enemy and their air attack still beating upon us. Here we ourselves have had experience of this attack and I expect you are beginning to feel impatient that there has bean this long love with nothing particular turning up. You cannot tell from appearances. Housing should go sometimes imagination mixing how far worse than they are yet without imagination, not much can be done. Those people who are imaginative see many more dangerous than perhaps exist certainly many more than will happen. But then they must also pray to be given that extra courage to carry this star reaching imagination. But for everyone, surely what we have gone through in this period I'm addressing myself to the school. Surely in this period of 10 months later, to lessen, never give in, never give in. Never, never, never in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give him except the convictions of honor and good sense never yield the force never yield to the apparently overwhelming night of the enemy. We stood all it only a year ago on too many countries, it seemed that our account was closed. We are finished all the tradition of our our school history, our songs this part of the history of our country always and finished and liquidated very different is removed. Today Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a Spanish across our state that he said our countries stood in the gap. There was no fishing, those thoughts of giving in and by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside the islands that we ourselves have doubted it. We now find ourselves in a position where I say we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer. You sang here a verse of a school song. You sang that extra verse written in my honor which I was very greatly complemented by on which you have repeated today. But there is one word in it. I want a walker. I wanted to do so last year, but I did not venture to it is the line, not less We praise in darker days I've obtained the headmaster permission to alter darker to sterner, not less. We praise in sterner days. Do not let a streak of darker days didn't speak rather than sterner days. These are not dark days. These are great days Greatest our country has ever lived And we went all Thank God that we have been allowed each of us according to our station to play a part in making these days memorable in the history of our race
