For more than a year, we British have stood alone, uplifted by your sympathy and respect sustained by our own unconquerable willpower and by the increasing growth and hopes off your massive aid in these British islands that look so small. Upon the math we stand, the faithful guardians off the right and dearest hopes of a dozen states and nations now gripped and tormented in a base and cruel servitude. Whatever happens, we shall endure to the end. But what is the explanation off the enslavement of Europe by the German Nazi regime? How did they do it? It is. But a few years ago, since one united gesture by the peoples great and small who now live broken in the dusk would have warded off from mankind the fearful or dill it has had to undergo. But there was no unity. There was no vision. The nation's were pulled down one by one, while the other gate on chatter, one by one each. In his turn, they let themselves be caught one after another.

Oh, no. This is not the end of the tail. The stars in their courses proclaim the deliverance of mankind. Not so easily. Tell the onward. Progress off the people's be barred. Not so easily shall the lights off freedom die. But but time is short. Every month the party is That's to the length and to the perils on the journey that will have to be made united. We stand divided, we fall divided. The Dark Ages returned united. We can save and guide the world.
