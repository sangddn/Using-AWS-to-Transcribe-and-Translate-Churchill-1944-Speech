the house will be aware that the king of the Belgians yesterday sent a peanut potentially to the German command, asking for a suspension of arms on the Belgian front. The British and French governments instructed their generals immediately to disassociate themselves from this procedure and to persevere in the operations in which they are now engaged. However, the German command has agreed to the Belgian proposals and the Belgian army seats to resist the enemies will. At four oclock this morning, I have no intention of suggesting to the house that we should attempt at this moment to pass judgment upon the action of the king of the Belgians in its capacity as commander in chief of the Belgian army, did army and fought very bravely and has both suffered and inflicted heavy losses. The Belgian government have disassociated itself from the action of the king. On declaring itself to be the only legal government of Belgium, has formally announced its resolve to continue the war at the side of the allies who have come to the age of Belgium at our urgent appeal, the situation of the British and French armies now engage in a most severe battle on be set on three sides and from the air in evidently extremely grave. The surrender of the Belgian army in this manner add appreciably to the agreement period. I expect to make a statement to the house on the general position when the result of the intense struggle now going on can be known and measured. This will not perhaps be until the beginning of next week. Meanwhile, Mr Speaker, the house should prepare itself for hard and heavy tiding. I've only to add that nothing which may happen in this battle can in any way relievers of our duty to defend the world cause to which way have vowed ourselves. Nor should it destroy our confidence in our power to make our way, as on former occasions in our history, through disaster and through grief, to the ultimate defeat of our enemy.
