rather more than a quarter over here. Mr Speaker has passed since the new government came into power in this country. What a cataract of disaster had poured out upon us. Since then, the trust will Dutch overwhelmed their beloved and respected sovereign, driven into exile the peaceful city of Rotterdam, scene of a massacre as hideous and brutal at anything in the 30 years war. Belgium invaded and beaten down our own fine expeditionary force cut off and almost captured. Escaping at it seemed only by a miracle on with the loss of all its equipment our ally France, out Italy in against us all, France in the power of the enemy, all its arsenals and vast masses of military material converted or convertible to the enemys youth. Ah, pocket government set up a tree, she which may at any moment before to become our so the whole western seaboard of Europe, from the North Cape to the Spanish frontier in German hand all the ports, all the airfields on the immense front, employed against us as potential springboards of invasions. Moreover, the German er power numerical so far outstripping ours has been brought so close to our island that what we used to dread greatly has come to pass on. The hostile bombers not only reach our shores in a few minutes on from many directions, but can be escorted by their fighting aircraft. Why, sir, if we had Bean confronted at the beginning of May with such a prospect, it would have seemed incredible that at the end of a period of horror and disaster or a dis point in a period of horror and disaster, we should stand erect sure of ourselves, masters of our fate and with the conviction of final victory burning unquenchable in our heart, if you would have believed we could survive, none would have believed that we should today not only feel stronger but should actually be stronger than we have ever seen before. Let us great. Our battle, which has bean in progress over this island for the last few weeks, has recently attained ah, high intensity. It is too soon to attempt to assign limits either to its scale or to its duration. We must certainly expect that greater efforts will be made by the enemy that any he has put forth. Hostile airfields are still being developed in France and the low countries and the movement of squadrons and material for attacking us. It's still proceeding. It is quite pain, sir, that Herr Hitler could not admit defeat in it air attack on Great Britain without sustaining most serious injury If, after all his boasting on blood curdling threats and lurid account trumped it around the world of the damage, we get infected of the vast numbers of our air force he has shot down. So he says, with so little lost to himself, if after tales of the panic stricken British crushed in their holes, cursing the plutocratic parliament, which has led them to such a plight. If after all this, his whole air onslaught were forced after a while, came Lee to Peter out. The furor reputation for veracity of statement might be seriously in Pune way. Maybe. Sure, therefore, that he will continue as long as he has the strength to do so and as long at any preoccupation he may have in respect of the Russian air force, allow him to do so. On the other hand, the conditions and course of the fighting have so far being favorable to us, I told the house two months ago. But whereas in France our fighter aircraft were wont to inflict a loss of two or 3 to 1 upon the Germans and in the fighting at Dunkirk, which was a kind of no man's land, a loss of about three or 4 to 1, we expected that in an attack on this island we should achieve a larger ratio. This has certainly come true. It must also be remembered that all the enemy machines on pilot which are shot down over our island or over the sea which surround it, are either destroyed or captured, whereas a considerable proportion of our machine, and also of our pilots are saved and soon again, in many cases, come into action. The gratitude of every home in our island, in our empire and indeed throughout the world except in the abode of the guilty goes out to the British airman who, undaunted by odds on wearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their promise on by their devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much old by so many could sell fuel all our hearts go out to the fighter pilots who's brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day. But we must never forget that all the time. Night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons travel fine to Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill aim. Their attacks, often under the heaviest try, are often mysterious loss with deliberate, careful discrimination and in fixed, shattering blows upon the whole of the technical, on war making structure of the Nazi power on no part of the Royal Air Force that the weight of the war for more heavily than on the daylight bombers who will play an invaluable part in the case of invasion and whose unflinching zeal it has been necessary in the meanwhile on numerous occasions to restrain, I hope. Indeed, I prayed that we shall not be found unworthy of our victory. If, after toil and tribulation it is granted to us for the rest, we have to gain the victory that is, there are, however, one direction in which we can see a little more clearly ahead way have to think not only for ourselves but for the lasting security of the cause and principles for which we are fighting. Aunt of the long Future of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Some months ago, we came to the conclusion that the interests of the United States and of the British Empire both required that the United States could have facilities for the naval and air defense off the Western Hemisphere against the attack of a Nazi power which might have acquired temporary but lengthy control of a large part of Western Europe and its formidable resources. We have therefore decided spontaneously without being asked or offered any inducement to inform the government of the United States that we would be dead to place such defense facilities at their disposal by leasing suitable sites in our transatlantic possessions for their greater security against the unmeasured dangers of the future. The principle of association of interests for common purposes between Great Britain and the United States had developed even before the war. Various agreements had been reached about certain small islands in the Pacific Ocean, which had become important as they are thrilling point in all this line of thought. We found ourselves in very coach harmony with the government of Canada presently we learned that anxiety was also felt in the United States about the air and naval defense of the Atlantic seaboard. And President Roosevelt has recently made it clear that he would like to discuss with us and with the Dominion of Canada and with newfound development off American naval and air facilities in new found land and in the West Indians. There is, of course, no question of any transference of sovereignty that has never been suggested, or of any action being taken without the consent or against the wishes off the various colonies. Concern. But for our own part, His Majesty's government are entirely willing to accord defense facilities to the United States on a 99 years lease hold basis. And we feel sure that our interests no less than theirs and the interests of the colonies themselves and of Canada and you found will be served thereby. So these are important steps. Undoubtedly, this process means that these two great organizations off the English speaking democracies, the British Empire on the United States will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage. For my own part, looking out from the future. I do not view the process with any misgivings. I could not stop it if I wish. No one can stop it Like the Mississippi. It just keeps rolling along. Let it roll, Let it roll on full flood. Inexorable, irresistible. Been ignorant to broader lands on better days.
