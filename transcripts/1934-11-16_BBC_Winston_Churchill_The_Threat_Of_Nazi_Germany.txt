Many people think that the best way to escape war into dwell upon it horrors and to imprint them vividly if, in the minds of the younger generation, they flaunt the grisly photographs before their eyes. They filled areas with tales of carnage. They dilate upon the ineptitude off generals and admirals. They denounced the crime and insensate folly of human strife. Now all this teaching ought to be very useful in preventing us from attacking or invading any other country if anyone outside of madhouse wish to do so. But how would it help us if we were attacked or invaded ourselves? That is the question we have to ask. Would the invaders consent of it it Lord Beaverbrook exhibition Or listen to the impassioned appeals of Mr Lloyd George? Would they agree to meet that famous South African general smack and have their inferiority complex removed in friendly, reasonable debate? I doubt it.
