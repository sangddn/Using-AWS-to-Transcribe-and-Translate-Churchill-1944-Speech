When? A week ago today, Mr Speaker, I asked the house to fix this afternoon as the occasion for a statement. I feared it would be my hard luck to announce the greatest military disaster in our long history. I thought on some good judges agreed with me that perhaps 20 or 30 0 men might be re embarked. But it certainly seems that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the AMIA Abriel Yep, would be broken up in the open field or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy tidings, which I called him in the House and the Nations to prepare themselves. A week ago. The whole route core on brain of the British Army, on which on around which we were to build and are to build the great British homage in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish ship in the field or balet into an ignominious on starving captivity. The enemy attacked us on all sides with great strength and fierceness and their main power part of that farmer on numerous airport was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in upon the narrow exit both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon up on the beaches, by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They sold magnetic minds in the channels and seeds. They sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than 100 strong in one formation to cross their bombs from the single pair that remained. And if in the sand dunes on which the troops had their only shelter their U boats, one of which was sunk on the motor launches took the toll of the vast traffic, which now began before five days, and intense struggle rains all their armored divisions off. What was left to them together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever narrowing, ever contracting a pending within which the British and French armies fought. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy, with the willing help of countless merchant seaman, strained every nerve to embark the British and allied troops. 220 lights warships and 650 other vessels were engaged they had to operate under difficult toast, often in adverse weather. Onda normal seats, the hail of bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery. Nor were the seas that Ive said themselves free from mines and torpedoes. He put in conditions such as the the diamond carried on with little or no rest. The days and nights front end making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing wisdom always men who may had rescue the number they have brought back other measure of their devotion and their courage. The hospital ships, which brought off many thousands of British and 20 wounded being no plainly marked. We're a special target. Finality bombs. But the men and women on board them never faulted in their duty. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force, which had already bean intervening in the battle provided brain could allow you're from our home base, is now use part of its main metropolitan fighter strength and struck at the German bombers, and that the fighters, which in large numbers protected this struggle with protracted in fifth Suddenly proceedings yard the crash and thunder and through the moment, but only for the moment, died away. A miracle of deliverance achieved by valor by birth of errors, my perfect discipline By faultless service, I reinforced by skill by unconquerable fidelity, It manifests to us all the enemy but hurled back as a retreating British troops. They were so roughly handled that he is not Harry. Their departure it is way must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Water not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance which would be noted it would gain by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the airports and work they only the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrated treatment. I've heard much talk of this. That is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it. This was a great trial of strength between the British and German airport. Can you conceive a greater objective for the German in the air, then to make evacuation from these beaches? Impossible. And you think all the ships, because it stayed almost to the extent of thousands could I have bean an objective of greater military importance and significance. The whole purpose of the wars of it. They tried hard and they were beaten back. They were frustrated in their task. We got the army way. And they have paid four fold for any losses which they have been driven. Sir, when we consider much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this island again and overseas attack. I'm not saying that. I find in the tractor shrub basis a bullet practical and we're sharing thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airman. The great French Army was very largely for the time being Charles back. And it's disturbed for the on Russia, a few thousands of armored vehicle. May it not also be that the Gordon civilization itself will be defended by the skill and devotion A few 1000 down. They're never had reasons, I suppose, in all the world in all the history of war such an opportunity for you, the knights for the round table, the Crusaders, or fall back into the past not only distant, but project These young men going forth every morning to guard their native land and all that we stand for holding in their hands the instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that every morn brought forth a noble trance on every chance brought forth a noble knight deserve our gratitude. Yes, do all the brave men in so many ways and on so many occasions already and continue ready to give life and all for their native land. Nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our army on so many men whose loved ones have passed to an agonizing weeks, but not blind us to the fact that what happened in France and Belgium, it took colossal military disaster. The French army has bean weakened. The Belgian army has been lost, a large part of those fortified lines in which so much faith has bean repose. He's gone many valuable mining district and factories have passed into the enemy's protection. The whole of the channel ports I hands is all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or drunk. We are told, sir, that Herr Hitler and a plan for invading the British Isles did it often being thought of before when Napoleon lead bullet line for a year with his fat bottom boat and in Grand Army, he was told by someone. There are better weed in England. There are certainly a great many more of them. Since the British expedition reports return, sir, I have myself full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing isn't addicted and if the best arrangements are made as they are being made, we should prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home to ride out the storm of war. Ondo. I've lived the menace of tyranny if necessary via yeah, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we're going to try to do. That is the root, all of His Majesty's government. Every man in them. There is a will of parliament in the nation, the British camp on the French Republic linked together in their court. Andi, in their need, will defend to the death, their native soil aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. We could go on to the end, Michelle, fighting bronze, which will try it on the seas and oceans. We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island. Whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields, Angela, Streaks, We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. Yeah, And if which I do not for a moment believe this island or large part of it was subjugated and starving in our empire beyond the seas armed and guarded by the British freak would carry on the struggle until in God's good time, the New World, with all its power, might steps forth to the rescue on deliberation of the old mhm.
